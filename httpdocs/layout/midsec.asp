This program is designed for anyone between the ages of 13-99 who is disconnected from their core. Some of the main side effects of a weak core are Diastasis Recti, umbilical hernia, outie bellybutton, and/or chronic back pain. Another issue can be pelvic floor dysfunctions like incontinence or intimacy issues affecting both men and women.  This program has evolved over time through experiences with working with clients along with advanced study of the core muscles, the pelvic floor and diaphragm. Itâ€™s very important to reconnect neurologically to these muscles and learn better day-to-day movements that will build long lasting strength for the future. Each client starts with different degrees of tissue weakness and can have years of improper movement habits to overcome. The program is six weeks of education and exercises, however, since everyone is different the program will be available for twelve weeks to meet you where you are.

Proper baby alignment and having a strong neurological connection with the core muscles, diaphragm, and pelvic floor are essential for the marathon of labor, delivery and recovery. Also included are videos on getting ready for the baby at home and printouts to start you off with some recovery exercises when you are ready. Each client starts with different degrees of tissue weakness and can have years of improper movement habits to overcome. The program is six weeks of education and exercises, however, since everyone is different the program will be available for twelve weeks to meet you where you are. Mothers with a Diastasis Recti are encouraged to start their program in the second trimester. Mothers without a Diastasis Recti can start in the third trimester.
